## Agent Instructions

**Important Guidelines for AI Agent Interactions:**

1. **Execution Verification**: All script executions and commands must be verified and approved by me before running.

2. **Temporary Scripts Management**: 
   - Use a `temp scripts` folder for all temporary scripts and files
   - Delete the `temp scripts` folder and its contents after successful execution runs
   - Do not leave temporary files in the project directory

3. **Session Guidelines**: These instructions should be loaded and followed each time I connect or start a new session with the agent.
